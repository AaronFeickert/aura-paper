# Aura

This is the LaTeX source of the technical paper for the Aura voting protocol.
Release versions are posted to the [IACR preprint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/543).

## Warning

**Elections and voting are hard.**
All election protocols have benefits and drawbacks.
No protocol is suitable for all use cases, and any given protocol (including Aura) may be not suitable for _your_ use case.
This preprint has not undergone formal external review, currently lacks a complete security model and protocol-level security proofs, and may contain errors making it unsuitable for deployment.

## Testing

Testing consists of a workflow in this repository that builds the paper and checks for errors and certain warnings.
You can view the resulting PDF as a build artifact.
